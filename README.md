# DS-Capstone

This capstone is the final course to get a professinal certificate in Data Science. It contains several notebooks from data collection, EDA, interactive visual analytics and a dashboard to a predictive analysis (Classification).

The project is about predicting if the first stage of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully. With the help of your Data Science findings and models, the competing startup you have been hired by can make more informed bids against SpaceX for a rocket launch.

Hope you like it, thanks.
